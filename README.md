## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository contains our innovative solution developed during START HACK 2025. Our project aims to address [specific challenge/goal to be added] while leveraging cutting-edge technologies and methodologies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python
- LangChain
- Ollama (Local LLM)
- Language Model Prompting

## üèóÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Python-Ollama Integration

This component provides a Python integration for calling local Ollama models using LangChain.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) installed and running locally
- A compatible Ollama model (default: llama3)

#### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy the environment file and edit as needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

#### Usage

Run the example script to see the client in action:

```bash
python example.py
```

#### Example code

```python
from src.ollama_client import OllamaClient
from src.prompt_templates import CODE_GENERATION_TEMPLATE, DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT

# Initialize the client
client = OllamaClient(model_name="llama3")

# Basic usage
response = client.generate_response("Explain quantum computing in simple terms.")
print(response)

# Using a template
code_response = client.generate_with_template(
    CODE_GENERATION_TEMPLATE,
    system_prompt=DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
    problem_description="Create a function to calculate prime numbers",
    language="Python"
)
print(code_response)
```

# Geospatial Data Visualization with LangGraph

This project provides a natural language interface to geospatial data from Mauritania, allowing users to request and visualize different types of data through simple text queries.

## Architecture

The system uses:
- **LangGraph** for orchestrating the processing workflow
- **LangChain + Groq** for natural language processing
- **FastAPI** for exposing the endpoints
- **Matplotlib/PIL** for visualization

## Available Data Types

The system can process and visualize the following types of data:

### 1. Precipitation Data (2010-2023)
- Annual precipitation measurements
- Files named in format `{year}R.tif`

### 2. Land Cover Data (2010-2023)
- MODIS Land Cover Classification
- Files named in format `{year}LCT.tif`

### 3. Primary Production (GPP) Data (2010-2021)
- Gross Primary Production (kg C/m¬≤/year)
- Files named in format `{year}_GP.tif`

### 4. Population Density Data (2010, 2015, 2020)
- Population density measurements for the Assaba region

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd builderz
```

2. Set up your environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

3. Add your Groq API key to `.env`:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

4. Run the backend:
```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. Natural Language Query
`POST /query`

Process a natural language query about geospatial data.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "query": "Show me the rainfall data for Assaba in 2020"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "I've created a visualization of the geospatial data for assaba in 2020. The visualization shows data from: Climate_Precipitation_Data. You can view it at /visualizations/assaba_2020_1710892345.png."
}
```

### 2. Direct TIF Access
`GET /fetch-tif`

Fetch a preprocessed multi-band TIF file directly.

**Query Parameters:**
- `region` (string): Region name (currently only "assaba" is supported)
- `year` (integer): Year for the data
- `datasets` (array): List of dataset names

**Example:**
```
GET /fetch-tif?region=assaba&year=2020&datasets=Climate_Precipitation_Data
```

## Example Queries

1. "Show me the rainfall data for Assaba in 2020"
2. "Visualize the vegetation productivity in Assaba for 2018"
3. "Create a map of land cover types in Assaba for 2015"
4. "Show population density data for Assaba in 2020"

## Architecture Details

The system uses a LangGraph workflow with the following nodes:

1. **Query Parser**: Extracts parameters from natural language
2. **Data Retriever**: Fetches the appropriate geospatial data
3. **Visualizer**: Creates visualizations for the requested data
4. **Response Generator**: Formats the response to the user

The workflow is dynamically adjusted based on whether the user is requesting data or visualization.

## Extending the System

To add support for new data types:
1. Add the data files to the appropriate directory in `/data`
2. Update the data loading logic in `processing.py` 
3. Add appropriate visualization support in `geo_langgraph.py`
